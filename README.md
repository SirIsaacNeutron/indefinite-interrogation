# indefinite-interrogation

This is a fairly faithful clone of the memory game Indefinite Interrogation. I say "fairly" because I don't have access to all of the questions and sound effects from the original game, and that hinders my ability to re-create it.

You can play it online at https://indefinite.netlify.app/. I got the button sound effects from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUOw02s9yV0, but the background music is from the original game.
